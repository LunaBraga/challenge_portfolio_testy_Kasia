## Subtask 3 👩‍💻💻

**Subtask 1: Why did I decide to take part in the Dare IT Challenge? **👩‍💻🚀

EN: My career path so far has not allowed me to develop my skills and knowledge of new technologies. That is why I decided to take part in the challenge and change the industry and profession.

I decided to take part in the course because I would like to learn new issues and learn about development opportunities. I really care about learning the skills and tools useful in the new profession.

PL: Moja dotychczasowa ścieżka kariery nie pozwalała mi na rozwijanie moich umiejętności i wiedzy dotyczącej nowych technologii. Dlatego zdecydowałam się podjąć wyzwanie i zmienić branżę oraz zawód.


Decyzje o wzięciu udziału w kursie podjełam ponieważ chiałabym uczyć się nowych zagadnień i poznać możliwości rozwoju. Bardzo zależy mi na nauce przydanych w nowym zwodzie umiejętności oraz narzędzi.


## Subtask 4 🚀✨

The application allows to view metrics, skills, player positions and player reports. 


**Application functionalities:**🚀💻📁✨

* Login with password and email
* Add player form - clearing the text and confirming the entered data
* Adding a language to the form
* Adding links to you tube
* Form removing texts from the form
* Reporting - editing
* Changing the language from PL to EN
* Counting the number of players, matches, reports, actions
* Filtering - players
* Showing selected items in columns - players
* Printing - players
* CSV download
* Searching for content on the site


**Application interface**

1. What I like about the interface: 👍💻

* readable dashboard
* clear language change, login/logout


2. I don't like about the interface: ☹📁💻

* using too many font sizes
* some colors are too similar like number of matches and number of reports
* on the page in the central pub there is chaos and it is difficult to find some elements like. reports, matches, etc.
* items number of players, etc. are not clickable - they do not redirect anywhere
* the logo is placed in the wrong place
* add player and players are separate - the form should be on the same page with added players
* no header with name, graphics, body copy
* on the mobile version on the top bar there is only a burger menu - there are no password icons nothing. A burger menu could be added to the right.
* in the mobile version, some tiles such as the number of players, etc. are also not clickable
* help links - in the middle and what do they mean? Is it shortcuts? They should be either in the menu or differently designed on the website + there should be more such links, e.g. to the match form and reports.


**The application is not intuitive. I'm having trouble finding:** ☹💻

* matches and a form with adding a match - I can do it by recently added in Activities
* reports - I don't see a form to add reports here either, there is simply add report and when I click it, the match form will appear ;)
* added links to reports and matches are missing in the menu in the dashboard
* dev team contact - link to slack
* no address details of the owner and footer
* no contact or contact form for problems on the website, etc.
* no date at the bottom of the page

## Subtask 3 💻🕵️‍♀️ 


1. This mobile application to buying different kinds of items rom people in Poland. 
2. The final users of the application are people listing items for sale in the application and people buying items.
3. The OLX application looks as if it was not designed specifically for the mobile version. 💻 In my opinion, it was reworked from the desktop project. Items in an app sometimes don't fit in containers. 🏮 The header does not have an upper bar with visible OLX colors. 🚩After entering the application, one element thanks to which I know that it is an application of this store is the logo in OLX in categories. The categories are not added alphabetically and it is difficult to know what the key to adding them in the application is. 📁 The application is not responsive and has not been adapted to all mobile devices. The application is about shopping and a Help button clearly visible on the page would be useful. Currently, it is deeper hidden in the Account and you have to scroll to find it. 🐕‍🦺 There is also no contact form or phone number for the helpdesk.📱 The application has many elements, but some of them are hard to find at first glance. A search engine for application elements would be helpful. There is only element search engine on the website. 🔍 The app also has an eco mode to save battery. 🔋 The application does not have two-factor verification 🔑 and scalable text. To sum up, the application should be designed for mobile devices. Currently, unfortunately, it is not user friendly.

4. 🪐The application could include a element search engine on the website. 🔍 The application also could has an eco mode to save battery. 🔋 Important thing could be also two-factor verification. They sould add form for help center or customer service. 🚀
5. 💻 Native apps need to be tested on separate Android and iOS operating systems. Native apps need to be reposive and that needs to be tested as well. More people are using mobile devices these days, and native and web apps need to be tested just as thoroughly. In mobile applications, it is also worth testing on different devices because the design may look completely different on different phones. It is important to check the number of elements in the native application and their visibility. On a small screen, cells may be hard to see or you have to scroll to find them. 📱
